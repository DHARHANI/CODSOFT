TO DO LIST:
1. Initializing the To-Do List 🚀
When you start the application, the TodoList class is initialized.

It tries to load existing tasks from todo.json.
If the file doesn't exist or is empty/corrupted, it starts with an empty list of tasks.
It also determines the next_id for new tasks to ensure unique IDs.
2. Adding a New Task ➕
You'll be prompted to enter a description for your task.
You can optionally add a due date (in YYYY-MM-DD format), set a priority (low, medium, or high), and assign a category.
A new task dictionary is created with a unique ID, the details you provided, a completed status of False, and a created_at timestamp.
The new task is added to your list, and the entire list is saved back to todo.json.
You'll see a ✅ Task added with ID [ID] confirmation.
3. Listing Tasks 📋
You have two main options:
List Pending Tasks: This shows only tasks that are not yet completed.
List All Tasks: This displays both pending and completed tasks.
Each task is displayed with its ID, completion status (✓ for completed, for pending), description, priority, due date (if provided), and category (if provided).
If no tasks match your criteria (e.g., no tasks in a specific category), you'll see a 📭 No tasks found matching your criteria. message.
You can also sort tasks by priority or due_date when listing.
4. Marking a Task as Completed ✅
You'll be asked to enter the ID of the task you want to mark as complete.
The application finds the task by its ID and updates its completed status to True and sets a completed_at timestamp.
The updated task list is saved.
A ✅ Task [ID] marked as completed. message confirms the action.
If the task is already completed, it will let you know with an ℹ️ emoji.
5. Deleting a Task 🗑️
You'll be asked for the ID of the task to delete.
The task is removed from the list.
The updated list is saved to todo.json.
You'll see a 🗑️ Task [ID] deleted. confirmation.
6. Clearing Completed Tasks 🧹
This function goes through your task list and removes all tasks that are marked as completed.
The remaining tasks are saved.
A message indicates how many tasks were cleared (e.g., 🧹 Cleared X completed tasks.).
If there are no completed tasks, it will show an ℹ️ emoji with a message.
7. Showing Statistics 📊
This provides a summary of your tasks.
It tells you how many tasks are ✅ Completed and how many are 🔄 Pending.
It also lists the number of tasks under each 🏷️ Category you've used.
8. Filtering and Sorting Tasks 🔍
This option allows you to refine your task view:
By Category: Enter a category name, and it will list all tasks belonging to that category.
By Priority: Enter a priority level (low, medium, or high), and it will display tasks with that priority.
Sort by Due Date: This will list all tasks, sorted by their due dates.



CALCULATOR:
Welcome & First Number Input 👋🔢

The calculator greets the user (implicitly, by asking for the first number).
It prompts the user to enter their first number.
The program then waits for the user to type in a number (e.g., 10) and press Enter.
Behind the scenes, it tries to convert this input into a decimal number (a float) so it can be used in calculations.
Example: If you type 5, the computer understands it as 5.0.
Second Number Input ➡️🔢

Next, the calculator asks for the second number.
Again, it waits for the user's input (e.g., 3).
This input is also converted into a float.
Example: If you type 2.5, the computer understands it as 2.5.
Operation Choice Display ➕➖✖️➗

Now, it's time to choose what to do with the numbers!
The calculator presents a menu of available operations to the user. This makes it clear what options are supported.
Typically, it will show:
"1. Addition (+)"
"2. Subtraction (-)"
"3. Multiplication (*)"
"4. Division (/)"
User Selects Operation 🤔✍️

The calculator then prompts the user to enter their choice for the operation (e.g., by typing +, -, *, or /).
The program awaits this input.
Performing the Calculation (The Brains of the Operation!) 🧠💡

This is where the magic happens! ✨
The program uses conditional logic (like if, elif, else statements) to figure out which operation the user picked.
Case 1: Addition (+) 🥳
If the user entered +, the calculator performs first_number + second_number.
Example: 5.0+2.5=7.5
Case 2: Subtraction (-) 🙁
If the user entered -, the calculator performs first_number - second_number.
Example: 5.0−2.5=2.5
Case 3: Multiplication (*) 🌟
If the user entered *, the calculator performs first_number * second_number.
Example: 5.0∗2.5=12.5
Case 4: Division (/) ➗⚠️
If the user entered /, there's a crucial extra check!
The calculator first asks: "Is the second_number (the divisor) equal to zero?"
If Yes (Zero): 🛑 It immediately stops the division and displays an "Error: Division by zero is not allowed." message. This prevents the program from crashing!
If No (Not Zero): ✅ It proceeds with first_number / second_number.
Example: 5.0/2.5=2.0
Case 5: Invalid Operation 🚫🚨
If the user enters anything other than +, -, *, or / (e.g., x or abc), the calculator doesn't know what to do.
It displays an "Error: Invalid operation choice." message.
Displaying the Result (or Error) 🎉❌

Finally, the calculator provides the output!
If the calculation was successful: It clearly prints the numbers, the operation, and the final result.
Example: "The result of 5.0+2.5 is: 7.5"
If there was an error (invalid input or division by zero): It displays the appropriate error message so the user knows what went wrong.
Error Handling (Safety Net) 🛡️🐞

Throughout the process, especially when converting user input to numbers, the calculator has a "safety net" called try-except.
try block: It attempts to perform the main operations (getting input, doing calculations).
except ValueError: If the user types something that can't be converted into a number (like "hello" instead of "5"), this catches that specific error and prints an "Error: Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers." message, preventing the program from crashing. 🙅‍♀️
except Exception as e: This is a general safety net for any other unexpected issues that might arise, catching them and displaying a generic error message, just in case! 🐛
